# Short description
Pizza Sales Analysis – Power BI Project
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze pizza sales performance using source data provided during coursework. The project involved calculating and visualizing key performance indicators such as total sales, total quantity sold, average number of pizzas per order, and year-over-year sales growth. Additionally, top 5 and bottom 5 pizzas were identified based on sales performance to highlight best-selling and underperforming products. The dashboard provides actionable insights into sales trends, customer ordering behavior, and product performance to support data-driven business decisions.
